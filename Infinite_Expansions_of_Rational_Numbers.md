# Infinite Expansions of Rational Numbers

## Introduction

It may seem odd at first that rational numbers can have an infinite representation. There are some examples that come to mind quickly, for example $\frac{1}{3}=0.\overline{3}$. However, there are more interesting examples. For example $0.236\overline{151}$ is also a rational number. In the first section I will explore some constructive theorems that will tells us about infinite representations of rational numbers. I will end the first section by showing that all repreating expansions of real numbers in a given radix are in rational. In the second section I will go through a couple examples on how to use these theorems to find a simple fractional representation of several repeating infinite expansions.
