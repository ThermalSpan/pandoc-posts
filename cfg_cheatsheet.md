# Context Free Grammer Cheatsheet
A context free grammer $G_A$ is defined to be a tuple $$G_A = (N, \sigma, P, S)$$ where

* $N$ is a finite set of symbols called <i>non-terminals</i>
* $\sigma$ is a finite set of symbols calles <i>terminaks</i>. The intersection of $N$ and $\sigma$ must be empty.
* $P$ is a finite set of <i>productions rules</i>.
* $S$ is a member of $N$ called the start symbol.
