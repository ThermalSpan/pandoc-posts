% Choice and Determinism in a Dynamic Universe

I have heard it said that "I can't image a world where people know they don't have free-will."[^1] This was spoken in the context of law, biology, and nueroscience. However other areas of knowledge could provide much need perspective on this situation. In particular chaos theory, the study of systems that are sensitive to initial coniditions. I would like to show how some of the ideas from the mathematical study of such systems can allow us to frame the talk of free-will in an entirely different way. In particular I would like to question the connection between choice and fate. We will start this by simultansly exploring the concepts of <i> dynamic systems </i>, and <i> choice and </i>. We discuss the ideas of choice and free-will. Then we will explore the conflict between the requirements of our universe requred in the first discussion as opposed the the second. In then this will allow us explore the first statement proposed, and to show how the universe of freewill has framed our understanding of life, and and how we could frame our understanding of life in terms of dynamics and the determinism.

We will establishing a common framework for the understanding of determinism by exploring the mathematical definition of a dynamic system. To start we will examine Wikipedia's defintion, "Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event."[^2] First, we see that deterinism is a concept used to describe and understand our universe. The defintion also mentions events, and conditions. I would say that an event refers to some arbitrary thing in the universe, but pairs it with a time. This definition also mentions conditions which could be considered to be a reference to set of things in at a particular moment in time in the universe. It would seem that event and condition both refer to the same class of thing. Furthermore, we see that there is a mapping between the two, that conditions can be turned into a state. We can do this becuase one condition can produce one event, and one event can be produced by only one condition 

The defintions requires an understanding of an event. We will consider the universe as a system, defined over some set of states $S$, and a map $F:S->S$. We also associate a so called initial state with a universe, $s_0$. Then

What are we trying to say here?

I think there is a sense of hopelessness when people confront a lack of free will. There is a lack of energy. We don't know what to imagine becuase there is no point in imagining what the future could hold when it is predetermined.

Does anyone feel that way? Or is just me?

Regardless, I don't think that this is a fair conclusion. 

Our fate is "pre-determined" only in cases where we are part of a system that is not sensitive to initial conditions.
This makes the heat death of the universe so scary, there is no avoiding it. There is nothing we can do to stop the inevitable flow of energy.
(Though, to be sure, two very similiar but not identical universes could end in VERY different configurations of atoms moving through the dark emptiness)

On the other hand, what the universe looks like in the mean time is quite chaotic.


1) There is nothing in this universe that is capable of computing what state follows this one.
    - Is this true?
2) Even if there was, we cannot take measurments of anything to an infinite degree of precision. 
3) As such, the only way to know the fate of such a system is to watch it get to the future. In such a case there is nothing that can tell us what will happen other than the passage of time.
