# Project Ideas

## Website Ideas

### Short Term Goals

* Have three articles that aren't totally embarrassing in the pandoc-posts project
* Write a better build script / or find an off the shelf solution that meets my needs.
* Fixup the connect page.
* Template the posts to include download link to pdf version

### Medium Term Goals

* Include some project pages.
* Perhaps host some documentation, though this is pending having a project that's worth documenting.
* To go with above, allow build script to build and include documentation in a clean way.
* Seperate build system / templater from the webpage source

### Long Term Goals

* Fix up home page to include some better ways sorting posts.
* Include at least one webGL / javascript interactive project

### Misc. Ideas For Website

* That progress bar that quantamagazine has on their articles is awesome.
* A page for linking to other cool websites. 
* I would love to add a search option. Rust Docs do it on a static website...

### Some Post Ideas

* Write about cargo cache commands and how you use them.
* Write about nvim setup, or at least one useful trick for configuring SpaceVim. Everyone has a vim post right? ;)
* Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet
* Create Integration methods cheatsheet
* Talk about some shader techniques, and maybe polish up shaderbus a bit.
* Walk through a cool math problem to show off all that awesome KaTeX
* Introduce some notation and explain its tradeoffs. Like bra-ket, or Einstein summation.
* A post talking about implementing prolog would be cool

### Some Cheatsheet ideas

* Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet
* Create Integration methods cheatsheet
* Maybe a Rust cheat sheet?
    + I think a clap cheat sheet would be awesome
    + And error_chain would also be useful
    + How to think in terms of arenas and such
* Maybe a vim cheat sheet?
    + Could split into areas like navigation
    + ex mode

## Software Project ideas

* Working on an implicit equation plotter
    + Or at least something that could generate a mesh for another plotter [plotly](https://plot.ly/).
* Build an rasterized image to vector graphic converter
    + I think I could use a cellular automata like process divide the image into like-color regions 
    + Construct boundaries of those regions using the border pixels as control points
    + Having a region outline option would be pretty slick

## Software to Explore

* [anime.js](anime.js)
* Docker
* Lisp or some variant 
* Grafite + Grafana
