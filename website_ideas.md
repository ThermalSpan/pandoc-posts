# Website Ideas

## Short Term Goals

* Have three articles that aren't totally embarrassing in the pandoc-posts project
* Write a better build script / or find an off the shelf solution that meets my needs.
* Fixup the connect page.
* Template the posts to include download link to pdf version

## Medium Term Goals

* Include some project pages.
* Perhaps host some documentation, though this is pending having a project that's worth documenting.
* To go with above, allow build script to build and include documentation in a clean way.
* Seperate build system / templater from the webpage source

## Long Term Goals

* Fix up home page to include some better ways sorting posts.
* Include at least one webGL / javascript interactive project

## Misc. Ideas For Website

* That progress bar that quantamagazine has on their articles is awesome.
* A page for linking to other cool websites. 

## Some Post Ideas

* Write about cargo cache commands and how you use them.
* Write about nvim setup, or at least one useful trick for configuring SpaceVim. Everyone has a vim post right? ;)
* Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet
* Create Integration methods cheatsheet
* Talk about some shader techniques, and maybe polish up shaderbus a bit.
* Walk through a cool math problem to show off all that awesome KaTeX
* Introduce some notation and explain its tradeoffs. Like bra-ket, or Einstein summation.
* A post talking about implementing prolog would be cool

## Some Cheatsheet ideas

* Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet
* Create Integration methods cheatsheet
* Maybe a Rust cheat sheet?
    + I think a clap cheat sheet would be awesome
    + And error_chain would also be useful
    + How to think in terms of arenas and such
* Maybe a vim cheat sheet?
    + Could split into areas like navigation
    + ex mode
