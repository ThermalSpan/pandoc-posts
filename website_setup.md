title: Website Setup

# Website Setup
This post documents how my website is setup. Since I deploy it via github pages, that really ammounts to how it is built.

The premise is that I have several component projects that all dump their build artifacts into a common root directory. I then run the a templater on that directory to produce the final website.

## Tools
You will need the following special tools in your `PATH`.

### Cobalt
[cobalt.rs](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs) is a static site generator. I am currently using:

    Cobalt 0.7.2

The best way to install cobalt is probably:

    cargo install cobalt-bin

### pandoc
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is best described on their homepage:

> If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife.

The version of pandoc I am using is:

    pandoc 1.19.2.1
    Compiled with pandoc-types 1.17.0.5, texmath 0.9, skylighting 0.1.1.4

I installed pandoc using brew:

    brew install pandoc

### blockpass
[blockpass](https://github.com/ThermalSpan/blockpass) is a small utility I wrote. Top of tree should be fine for now. You can install by downloading and building it:

    git clone https://github.com/ThermalSpan/blockpass.git
    cd blockpass
    cargo install

## Dependences

These are are the projects that contribute content to the website.

### KaTeX
[blockpass](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) is a javascript library for math rendering. From Khan Academy! I am currently using the following tag:

    v0.7.1

Pandoc supports KaTeX in html, so that's how I use it.

### pandoc-posts
[pandoc-posts](https://github.com/ThermalSpan/pandoc-posts) is the repository where most of the posts live. Top of tree on the master branch should be sufficient. Drafts live in other branches.

### thermalspan.github.io-source
[thermalspan.github.io-source](https://github.com/ThermalSpan/thermalspan.github.io-source) is kitchen sink for this website. All the templates, misc pages, and such live here. And for now the "build system" does too, but I'd like to rip that out.


## Notes

The pandoc posts project is really important, and is where most of the content lives. I would like to keep it as a seperate repisotory since it represents a good content divide. It also allows the issue tracker to be used soley for content related issues. I can also the branches to cleany mark drafts and such.

My short term goals are:

* Have three articles that aren't totally embarrassing in the pandoc-posts project
* Write a better build script / or find an off the shelf solution that meets my needs.
* Fixup the connect page

My medium term goals are:

* Template the posts to include download link to pdf version
* Include some projects
* Perhaps host some documentation, though this is pending having a project that's worth documenting
* To go with above, allow build script to build and include documentation in a clean way

My long term goals are:

* Seperate build system / templater from the webpage source
* Include fancier front page options for sorting through options
* Include a source option
* Include at least one webGL / javascript interactive project

Some nifty ideas that might be worth implementing:

* That progress bar that quantamagazine has on their articles is awesome.

Some Post ideas:

* Talk about cargo cache commands and how you use them
* Talk about nvim setup, or at least one useful trick for configuring SpaceVim
* Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet
* Walk through a cool math problem to show off all that awesome KaTeX
* Introduce some notation and explain its tradeoffs. Like bra-ket, or Einstein summation.
* Take some notes on the many papers you think you've read, maybe a prolog implementation paper
* To maintain a list of other notable places on the web. Like other personal websites and such. Though, this might be better as a pure website for interactive purposes
